Educates is a system for hosting interactive workshop environments in
Kubernetes, or a local docker environment. It can be used for self paced or
supervised workshops. It can also be useful where you need to package up demos
of applications hosted in Kubernetes.

In this workshop you will learn the basics of how to install Educates using
`kapp-controller` from the Carvel tools.
