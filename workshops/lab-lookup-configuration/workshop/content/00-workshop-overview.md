Educates is a system for hosting interactive workshop environments which can be
installed into a Kubernetes cluster.

This workshop provides a more indepth look at configuring the Educates lookup
service, in particular how to configure it to span multiple clusters.

It is assumed that you have already undertaken the workshop on how to perform
the initial installation of the Educates lookup service, which covers basic
concepts needed when configuring the Educates lookup service, such as clusters,
tenants and clients.
