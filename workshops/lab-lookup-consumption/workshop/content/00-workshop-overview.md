Educates is a system for hosting interactive workshop environments which can be
installed into a Kubernetes cluster.

This workshop provides a more in depth look at usage of the Educates lookup
service REST API by a custom front end web portal.

It is assumed that you have already undertaken the workshops on how to install
and configure the Educates lookup service, which covers basic concepts needed
when configuring the Educates lookup service, such as clusters, tenants and
clients.
