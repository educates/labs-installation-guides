title: Kubernetes Cluster
---

In this workshop, in order to demonstrate how to install a standalone instance
of the Educates lookup service a single empty virtual cluster has been created.

Installation of the Educates lookup service requires that the Kubernetes cluster
already has a functional ingress controller installed. How to install an ingress
controller is not covered by this workshop. In the case of the virtual cluster
being used here, ingress is already configured to work. For this workshop secure
ingress will not be used, but notes on how to use secure ingress are given later
in the workshop.
