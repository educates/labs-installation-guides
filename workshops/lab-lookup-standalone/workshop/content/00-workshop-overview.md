title: Workshop Overview
---

Educates is a system for hosting interactive workshop environments which can be
installed into a Kubernetes cluster.

This workshop provides instructions on how to install a standalone instance of
the Educates lookup service. The process described here would be required if
wanting to use the lookup service with Educates 2.7.4 clusters, or if wanting to
install the lookup service separate to the Educates clusters being managed.

This workshop is mainly of interest to anyone who has to manage the lookup
service. Someone who will only be a consumer of the lookup service need not know
how to install it or configure it, but the concepts explained in this workshop
as to how it is configured and accessed may still be of interest.
