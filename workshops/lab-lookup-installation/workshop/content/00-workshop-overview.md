title: Workshop Overview
---

Educates is a system for hosting interactive workshop environments which can be
installed into a Kubernetes cluster.

This workshop provides an introduction to the Educates lookup service, including
instructions for how to install it and configure it.

This workshop is mainly of interest to anyone who has to manage the lookup
service. Someone who will only be a consumer of the lookup service need not know
how to install it or configure it, but the concepts explained in this workshop
as to how it is configured may still be of interest.
